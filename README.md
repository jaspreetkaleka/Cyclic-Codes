# Cyclic Codes
Cyclic codes are error-correcting codes, where the circular shifts of each codeword gives another word that belongs to the code.

A binary code is cyclic if it is a linear [n, k] code and if for every codeword (c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, . . . , c<sub>n</sub>) âˆˆ C we also have that (c<sub>n</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, . . . , c<sub>n-1</sub>) is also a codeword in C.
